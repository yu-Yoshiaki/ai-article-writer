# AI Article Writer Development Guide

## Primary Reference

**IMPORTANT**: All development work on this project must follow the guidelines and workflows defined in [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md).

## Key Points

- [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) contains the complete development guidelines, technology stack, and project structure
- The new efficient development structure in [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) includes:
  - ðŸš€ Usage methods for efficient development workflows
  - File mapping system for minimizing context
  - Feature-specific implementation guides
  - Implementation templates

## Development Workflow

1. **Always read [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) first** before starting any development work
2. Follow the "ðŸš€ ä½¿ç”¨æ–¹æ³•" section for efficient development workflows
3. Use the structures/ directory system as defined in [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md)
4. Reference the specific implementation guides mentioned in [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md)

## Efficient Context Management

- Use `structures/quick-reference.md` for rapid information access
- Use `structures/file-mapping.md` to identify affected files
- Use `structures/implementation-guides/` for detailed feature implementation
- Use `structures/implementation-templates/` for consistent code patterns

**No additional rules are needed** - [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) provides complete guidance for this project.
